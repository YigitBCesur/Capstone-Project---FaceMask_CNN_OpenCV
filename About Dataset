# About Dataset  :

The objective is to create a Real-Time Face MaskDetector which can solve monitoring issues in crowded areas  such
as  Airports,  Metros,  etc.  using  CNN  and OpenCV

### Dataset Description

The dataset is an artificial set of face mask images

* •Total Images: 1376

* •with_mask images: 

* •without_mask images: 

The goal is to create a Deep Learning model to detect in real-time whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.

### Aim of the Project

The dataset consists of 1376 images consisting of two classes–with_mask and without_mask.
